4 modules in this folder, they are:

$ python preprocess.py   	 #generate train.npz and test.npz
$ python knn.py 		 	 #generate knn results (see below)
$ python naivebayes.py 	 	 #generate naivebayes results (see below)
$ python compare_methods.py  #generate compare methods results

First of all, unzip original data(http://cs.nju.edu.cn/dxy/review_sentiment.rar) as ./data 
Then, try preprocess.py to generate train.npz and test.npz
Other 3 modules will not run properly without these .npz file
